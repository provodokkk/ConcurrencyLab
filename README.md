### About the program
- __Part 1:__
Parallel processing of an array (increasing each member by a constant) using the std::async asynchronous call mechanism. To do this, we split the array into M equal parts, processing each in a separate thread.
>The size of the array, the number of parts M and the launch policy are set by the user from the keyboard.

- __Part 2:__

The following scheme has been implemented:
![scheme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105476685/177993634-877824b3-5b5c-4a44-a273-b891a8d522ec.png)

The system consists of N generators and one processor. Generators generate random numbers and pass them to the processor, which prints them to the console. Each of the entities (generator/processor) is executed in a separate thread.
>The number of generators and the startup policy is set by the user from the keyboard.
